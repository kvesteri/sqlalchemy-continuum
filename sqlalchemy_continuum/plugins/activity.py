"""
The ActivityPlugin is the most powerful plugin for tracking changes of
individual entities. If you use ActivityPlugin you probably don't need to use
TransactionChanges nor TransactionMeta plugins.

You can initalize the ActivityPlugin by adding it to versioning manager.

::

    activity_plugin = ActivityPlugin()

    make_versioned(plugins=[activity_plugin])


ActivityPlugin uses single database table for tracking activities. This table
follows the data structure in `activity stream specification`_, but it comes
with a nice twist:

    ==============  =========== =============
    Column          Type        Description
    ==============  =========== =============
    id              BigInteger  The primary key of the activity
    verb            Unicode     Verb defines the action of the activity
    data            JSON        Additional data for the activity in JSON format
    transaction_id  BigInteger  The transaction this activity was associated
                                with
    object_id       BigInteger  The primary key of the object. Object can be
                                any entity which has an integer as primary key.
    object_type     Unicode     The type of the object (class name as string)

    object_tx_id    BigInteger  The last transaction_id associated with the
                                object. This is used for efficiently fetching
                                the object version associated with this
                                activity.

    target_id       BigInteger  The primary key of the target. Target can be
                                any entity which has an integer as primary key.
    target_type     Unicode     The of the target (class name as string)

    target_tx_id    BigInteger  The last transaction_id associated with the
                                target.
    ==============  =========== =============


Each Activity has relationships to actor, object and target but it also holds
information about the associated transaction and about the last associated
transactions with the target and object. This allows each activity to also have
object_version and target_version relationships for introspecting what those
objects and targets were in given point in time. All these relationship
properties use `generic relationships`_ of the SQLAlchemy-Utils package.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently all changes to parent models must be flushed or committed before
creating activities. This is due to a fact that there is still no dependency
processors for generic relationships. So when you create activities and assign
objects / targets for those please remember to flush the session before
creating an activity::


    article = Article(name=u'Some article')
    session.add(article)
    session.flush()  # <- IMPORTANT!
    first_activity = Activity(verb=u'create', object=article)
    session.add(first_activity)
    session.commit()


Targets and objects of given activity must have an integer primary key
column id.


Create activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Once your models have been configured you can get the Activity model from the
ActivityPlugin class with activity_cls property::


    Activity = activity_plugin.activity_cls


Now let's say we have model called Article and Category. Each Article has one
Category. Activities should be created along with the changes you make on
these models. ::

    article = Article(name=u'Some article')
    session.add(article)
    session.flush()
    first_activity = Activity(verb=u'create', object=article)
    session.add(first_activity)
    session.commit()


Current transaction gets automatically assigned to activity object::

    first_activity.transaction  # Transaction object


Update activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The object property of the Activity object holds the current object and the
object_version holds the object version at the time when the activity was
created. ::


    article.name = u'Some article updated!'
    session.flush()
    second_activity = Activity(verb=u'update', object=article)
    session.add(second_activity)
    session.commit()

    second_activity.object.name  # u'Some article updated!'
    first_activity.object.name  # u'Some article updated!'

    first_activity.object_version.name  # u'Some article'


Delete activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The version properties are especially useful for delete activities. Once the
activity is fetched from the database the object is no longer available (
since its deleted), hence the only way we could show some information about the
object the user deleted is by accessing the object_version property.

::


    session.delete(article)
    session.flush()
    third_activity = Activity(verb=u'delete', object=article)
    session.add(third_activity)
    session.commit()

    third_activity.object_version.name  # u'Some article updated!'


Local version histories using targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The target property of the Activity model offers a way of tracking changes of
given related object. In the example below we create a new activity when adding
a category for article and then mark the article as the target of this
activity.



::


    session.add(Category(name=u'Fist category', article=article))
    session.flush()
    activity = Activity(
        verb=u'create',
        object=category,
        target=article
    )
    session.add(activity)
    session.commit()


Now if we wanted to find all the changes that affected given article we could
do so by searching through all the activities where either the object or
target is the given article.


::

    import sqlalchemy as sa


    activities = session.query(Activity).filter(
        sa.or_(
            Activity.object == article,
            Activity.target == article
        )
    )

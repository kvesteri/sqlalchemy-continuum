Transactions
============


Transaction
-----------


For each committed transaction SQLAlchemy-Continuum creates a new Transaction record.

Transaction can be queried just like any other sqlalchemy declarative model.

::


    from sqlalchemy_continuum import transaction_class
    Transaction = transaction_class(Article)

    # find all transactions
    session.query(Transaction).all()


UnitOfWork
----------

For each database connection SQLAlchemy-Continuum creates an internal UnitOfWork object.
Normally these objects are created at before flush phase of session workflow. However you can also
force create unit of work before this phase.

::


    uow = versioning_manager.unit_of_work(session)


Transaction objects are normally created automatically at before flush phase. If you need access
to transaction object before the flush phase begins you can do so by calling the create_transaction method
of the UnitOfWork class.


::

    transaction = uow.create_transaction(session)


The version objects are normally created during the after flush phase but you can also force create those at any time by
calling make_versions method.


::

    uow.make_versions(session)


Workflow internals
------------------

Consider the following code snippet where we create a new article.

::


    article = Article()
    article.name = u'Some article'
    article.content = u'Some content'
    session.add(article)
    session.commit()



This would execute the following SQL queries (on PostgreSQL)


1. INSERT INTO article (name, content) VALUES (?, ?)
    params: ('Some article', 'Some content')
2. INSERT INTO transaction (issued_at) VALUES (?)
    params: (datetime.utcnow())
3. INSERT INTO article_version (id, name, content, transaction_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
    params: (<article id from query 1>, 'Some article', 'Some content', <transaction id from query 2>)

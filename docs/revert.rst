Reverting changes
=================

One of the major benefits of SQLAlchemy-Continuum is its ability to revert changes.


Revert update
-------------

::

    article = Article(name=u'New article', content=u'Some content')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit(article)

    version = article.versions[0]
    article.name = u'Updated article'
    session.commit()

    version.revert()
    session.commit()

    article.name
    # u'New article'



Revert delete
-------------

::

    article = Article(name=u'New article', content=u'Some content')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit(article)

    version = article.versions[0]
    session.delete(article)
    session.commit()

    version.revert()
    session.commit()

    # article lives again!
    session.query(Article).first()




Revert relationships
--------------------

Sometimes you may have cases where you want to revert an object as well as some of its relation to certain state. Consider the following model definition:


::

    class Article(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'article'
        __versioned__ = {}

        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
        name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))


    class Tag(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'tag'
        __versioned__ = {}

        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
        name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))
        article_id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey(Article.id))
        article = sa.orm.relationship(Article, backref='tags')


Now lets say some user first adds an article with couple of tags:


::


    article = Article(
        name=u'Some article',
        tags=[Tag(u'Good'), Tag(u'Interesting')]
    )

    session.add(article)
    session.commit()


Then lets say another user deletes one of the tags:


::


    tag = session.query(Tag).filter_by(name=u'Interesting')

    session.delete(tag)
    session.commit()



Now the first user wants to set the article back to its original state. It can be achieved as follows (notice how we use the relations parameter):


::


    article = session.get(Article, 1)
    article.versions[0].revert(relations=['tags'])
    session.commit()
